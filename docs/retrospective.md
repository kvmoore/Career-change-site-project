## Retrospective

Building the final project was a little challenging but interesting as well as a great learning experience. Throughout the project, my biggest concern was hoping that I understood the guidelines and instructions. Also, given the fact that I’m somewhat new to some of these concepts, there was bit of concern about getting them done correctly.

 I was able to create the files needed, create the file structure and create a repository fairly easily. As far as creating the repository, I had a little bit of difficulty, I somehow didn’t realize I had to add a workflow file to the repository when using git hub actions to deploy. I also wasn’t sure I added enough content or structure in the HTML pages knowing that the site was only suppose to be a rough prototype. And lastly sometimes I feel I can get stuck, maybe not the greatest at coming up with thoughtful content. I do feel I am working on and getting better at this. 

As far as what I would do differently I would say manage time a bit better and gain the knowledge needed to finish a website like this quickly and efficiently.
