# How to navigate a career change website

The purpose of this website is to create a small website of content that gets into discussion, valuable insights, and practical tips about the realities, challenges, and process of navigating a career change. It is aimed a people like me who are older and either thinking bout or going through a career change.

The project also contains a scope, plan and retrospective files for viewing that were created as part of a project proposal.
